# ReWire-by-Example Tutorial

This is an online tutorial written using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). 

To use this tutorial:
* Install `mdbook`: either from the above github or via homebrew.
* Assuming that ReWire is installed HERE, `cd HERE/tutorial/rewire-by-example`
* Type `mdbook serve`; this will allow you to view the tutorial on `http://localhost:3000` with your browser.

I will be adding chapters to this tutorial periodically. If there's a particular thing you're looking for, just send me an email.
