-- | This module defines operations related to monads in ReWire, including 
-- functions for defining looping monadic actions, and simplifying a tower
-- of monad transformers down to the simple ReacT action required by rwc
-- It provides type synonyms for distinguishing looping devices and stateful devices
-- that run indefinitely.
